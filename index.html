DESCRIPTION
_______________

V3(Current)

This tool set has four distinct rectangle drawing tools that are used inside the sketch
environment for part files, assembly files, and drawing files.  They are located on a 
separate ribbon panel called "Rectangles" on the "Sketch" ribbon tab. They are as follows:

Center Point Rectangle (default displayed button):
	This rectangle tool draws a rectangle about the origin of where the user picks.  It
	constrains the rectangle by adding a vertical and horizontal alignment constraint to
	one of the vertical and horizontal lines respectively as well as a coincident constraint
	to the geometry that the user selects.  If no geometry is selected, then only the vertical
	and horizontal alignment constraints will be used.
Diagonal Center Point Rectangle:
	This rectangle tool draws a rectangle about the origin of where the user picks and adds
	a diagonal line that goes from one corner to the opposite corner with a sketch point constrained
	to the mid-point of the diagonal line.  By virtue of the diagonal line, the rectangle relationship 
	to the origin is maintained, but if the user selects existing geometry then a coincident
	constraint is added to the origin sketch point and selected geometry.
Horizontal Mid-Point Rectangle:
	This rectangle tool draws a rectangle that eminates from the mid-point of one of the 
	horizontal lines of the rectangle.  A sketch point is then added and constrained to 
	that line's mid-point.  If the user selects existing geometry, then the sketch point
	is constrained to the existing geometry accordingly.
Vertical Mid-Point Rectangle:
	This rectangle tool draws a rectangle that eminates from the mid-point of one of the 
	vertical lines of the rectangle.  A sketch point is then added and constrained to 
	that line's mid-point.  If the user selects existing geometry, then the sketch point
	is constrained to the existing geometry accordingly.

There is also the ability to configure the user interface for this add-in.  You may use the original
drop-down control to access the commands or you may switch to a panel style layout.  To configure the
user interface simply go to the application menu (the big "I" in the upper left corner of Inventor) and
choose the "Rectangle Tools Settings" command and it will bring up a dialog box with two radio buttons
which allow you to set the desired user interface for these commands. This will require a restart of 
Inventor for the change to take effect.


SOURCE CODE
_________________

This is an open source project.

Source code was written in C# and is provided at https://github.com/Qube-it/Rectangle-Tools-2010-2012

SUPPORTED VERSIONS
______________________

This add-in supports Inventor 2010 forward and does not support the classic
interface. 


INSTALLATION
________________ 

An installer wizard ("Qube-It Tools.msi") has been provided. Since this add-in was
built using .NET 3.5 framework, you will need that framework to run the add-in.  The
installer will automatically detect this and install it if you don't have it. Follow 
the prompts for quick installation.  You can change the location of the install folder 
if you like.

You may uninstall the add-in through your system's control panel. You may also simply
uncheck the "Load on Startup" box if you're only looking to unload it without uninstalling it.


KNOWN ISSUES
_________________

This add-in does not support the classic interface by design. 

The default rectangle button shown on the Rectangles tab is the Center point Rectangle.
When the user selects one of the other rectangle tools, they will remain displayed
and "pressed" during the life of the tool, but when the user exits the tool or starts another
tool, the displayed button will go back to being the Center Point Rectangle tool again.  
This is intentional because even if the other tools are displayed (i.e. horizontal or 
vertical mid-point rectangle tools) and the user clicks that displayed button, the center point rectangle tool 
will be what gets activated (unless the user selects the drop down first). 

There is no support for the heads up display to be utilized with these tools. It is not 
supported through the API yet.


BUG FIXES
__________________
R2 fixes:
			1) Added support for the construction line toggle.
			2) Added the Diagonal Center Point Rectangle tool to provide for a more robust
			   rectangle so that there are no unexpected results when the corners are filleted 
			   or chamfered.
			3) Changed the behavior of the tool so that it acts in a manner that is consistent with 
			   the behavior of the current Inventor rectangle tools where the command stays 
			   active until the user escapes out of the command or starts a new command.

R3 fixes:
			1) Added support for a keyboard shortcut to TERMINATE a running rectangle command
			2) Added the ability for a user to configure the user interface.

MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR USE.  QUBE-IT DESIGN, INC. 
DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE OPERATION OF THE PROGRAM WILL BE
UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR FREE.</p><h2>Dependencies</h2>
<p>You'll need two dll's that I made separately from this project.  They each have an open source repository of their own under my user ID (Qube-it).  They are InventorDocumentProperties and InventorEvents2010.  You can download each of those projects, build them to create the dll files, and then re-add the reference by pointing to the built dll's.

Of course you'll need the Autodesk.Inventor.Interop dll assembly as well, but that should be already on your system from your installation of Inventor.</p>
<h2>Install</h2>
<p>If you're just using the add-in and not interested in the source code, then uninstall the previous version of the rectangle tools before installing the latest version.

The old version is under the name "Qube-it Tools" and can be uninstalled via the Add/Remove programs (or just "Programs") on Windows.

The installer for this Add-in is located in the "Downloads" area.  It's an MSI file.</p>
<h2>License</h2>
<p>I'm not hip on all the GNU license jargon so I can't articulate a proper license model for the companies who really need it, but I will say this:

This add-in is free and open source and extends any Autodesk licensing since it's built on top of Autodesk Inventor's API.
