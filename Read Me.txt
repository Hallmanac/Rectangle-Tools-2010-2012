DESCRIPTION
_______________

R1
This tool set is three distinct rectangle drawing tools that are used inside
the sketch environment for part files, assembly files, and drawing files.  They are a 
Center Point Rectangle, a Horizontal Mid-Point Rectangle, and a Vertical Mid-Point 
Rectangle. The Horizontal and Vertical mid-point rectangles create a rectangle from
the mid-points of one of the horizontal or vertical lines of the rectangle. The 
Center Point Rectangle creates a rectangle about the origin of where the user picks.
These tools are located on the sketch tab in the ribbon interface as a separate panel
called "Rectangles". 

==============================

R2(Current)
This tool set has four distinct rectangle drawing tools that are used inside the sketch
environment for part files, assembly files, and drawing files.  They are located on a 
separate ribbon panel called "Rectangles" on the "Sketch" ribbon tab. They are as follows:

Center Point Rectangle (default displayed button):
	This rectangle tool draws a rectangle about the origin of where the user picks.  It
	constrains the rectangle by adding a vertical and horizontal alignment constraint to
	one of the vertical and horizontal lines respectively as well as a coincident constraint
	to the geometry that the user selects.  If no geometry is selected, then only the vertical
	and horizontal alignment constraints will be used.
Diagonal Center Point Rectangle:
	This rectangle tool draws a rectangle about the origin of where the user picks and adds
	a diagonal line that goes from one corner to the opposite corner with a sketch point constrained
	to the mid-point of the diagonal line.  By virtue of the diagonal line, the rectangle relationship 
	to the origin is maintained, but if the user selects existing geometry then a coincident
	constraint is added to the origin sketch point and selected geometry.
Horizontal Mid-Point Rectangle:
	This rectangle tool draws a rectangle that eminates from the mid-point of one of the 
	horizontal lines of the rectangle.  A sketch point is then added and constrained to 
	that line's mid-point.  If the user selects existing geometry, then the sketch point
	is constrained to the existing geometry accordingly.
Vertical Mid-Point Rectangle:
	This rectangle tool draws a rectangle that eminates from the mid-point of one of the 
	vertical lines of the rectangle.  A sketch point is then added and constrained to 
	that line's mid-point.  If the user selects existing geometry, then the sketch point
	is constrained to the existing geometry accordingly.


SOURCE CODE
_________________

C# source code will be provided with this add-in as a Visual Studio 2010 Solution when the
July/August issue of "The Creative Inventor" online magazine has been issued.  To subscribe
to "The Creative Inventor" online magazine, please go to http://www.teknigroup.com/ and
click on the magazine icon button in the lower left corner.


SUPPORTED VERSIONS
______________________

This add-in supports Inventor 2010 forward and does not support the classic
interface. 


INSTALLATION
________________ 

An installer wizard ("Qube-It Tools.msi") has been provided. Since this add-in was
built using .NET 3.5 framework, you will need that framework to run the add-in.  The
installer will automatically detect this and install it if you don't have it. Follow 
the prompts for quick installation.  You can change the location of the install folder 
if you like.

You may uninstall the add-in through your system's control panel. You may also simply
uncheck the "Load on Startup" box if you're only looking to unload it without uninstalling it.


KNOWN ISSUES
_________________

This add-in does not support the classic interface by design. 

The default rectangle button shown on the Rectangles tab is the Center point Rectangle.
When the user selects one of the other rectangle tools, they will remain displayed
and "pressed" during the life of the tool, but when the user exits the tool or starts another
tool, the displayed button will go back to being the Center Point Rectangle tool again.  
This is intentional because even if the other tools are displayed (i.e. horizontal or 
vertical mid-point rectangle tools) and the user clicks that displayed button, the center point rectangle tool 
will be what gets activated (unless the user selects the drop down first). 

There is no support for the heads up display to be utilized with these tools. It is not 
supported through the API yet.


BUG FIXES
__________________
R2 fixes:
			1) Added support for the construction line toggle.
			2) Added the Diagonal Center Point Rectangle tool to provide for a more robust
			   rectangle so that there are no unexpected results when the corners are filleted 
			   or chamfered.
			3) Changed the behavior of the tool so that it acts in a manner that is consistent with 
			   the behavior of the current Inventor rectangle tools where the command stays 
			   active until the user escapes out of the command or starts a new command.
